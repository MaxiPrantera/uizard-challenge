## UIZard Challenge

Overall Context:

YouÂ´re building a simple Hacker News ("https://news.ycombinator.com) clone. The app will fetch data from a public JSON API endpoint and display it in a simple vievwer.
The viewer should have two panels; a left pane showing the top 10 stories; and a right panel displaying a preview of the selected story using an iframe.
When a user clicks a story in the left panel, the right panel should switch to the selected story.
